# FEMA

## Description
Shell-script based Webscraper to pull the FEMA id, type, location, and date of disaster declarations from the [Federal Emergency Management Agency website](https://www.fema.gov/disasters)

## Getting started:
* This is written in Bash a unix shell script.  Windows users, you can do this through a Bash for Windows utility (I recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/); it is free and open source)
* This assumes a Unix/Linux based filesystem.  For Windows, change the download and file directories accordingly (specifically, replace the "~" home directory with wherever you are working in Windows).
* Valid through declarations of April 28th, 2019

## Acknowledgement
* This software can be used for any non-commercial purpose as long as Patrick W. Zimmerman of [Principally Uncertain](https://principallyuncertain.com) is given credit for its creation.  
* More help for digital historians, data journalists, and interested folk can be found by joining the [Digital Historians Slack group](https://forms.gle/hJUGumGie913mn5y7)
